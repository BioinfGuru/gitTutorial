## GIT: Create your first “New repository”

This is a work in progress

These are the basic instructions for setting your first repo. To learn more about GIT, I highly recommend reading a few chapters from ["Getting started in the command line"](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line). The most useful of GIT commands are included in the attached file [git.txt](http://phobos/k.condon/git/blob/master/git.txt)

* [Generate an SSH key](http://phobos/help/ssh/README) from inside a UTAH terminal
* [Add your SSH key](http://phobos/profile/keys)
* Don’t choose to deploy the key (not really sure what this does)
* Choose a project name (leave the path as phobos/NGS) e.g. “phobos/NGS/test”
* Choose public visibility level
* Use “create a new repository” to clone a project from phobos to Utah
* Use “ Existing folder or Git repository” to push a project from Utah to phobos
