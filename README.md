## GIT: Clone your first repository

This is a work in progress

These are the basic instructions for setting your first repo. To learn more about GIT, I highly recommend reading a few chapters from ["Getting started in the command line"](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line). The most useful of GIT commands are included in the attached file [git.txt](https://github.com/roonysgalbi/gitTutorial/blob/master/git.txt)

* [Create an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys/) to link your computer to your github account
* On github, enter a repository and click on the green "Clone or download" button. Copy the SSH key + passphrase in the box
* In the terminal, cd into the directory in which the new repository will be
* git clone [enter copied key and passphrase here]
* cd into the cloned directory
* git remote -v
