## GETTING STARTED WITH GIT

GIT is a distributed version system that creates a repository (repo) in your project folder, allowing you to monitor (track) changes to your project during development, and allows you to try multiple, simoultaneous development lines or roll-back unwanted changes. Conceptually, GIT allows storage of an online canonical copy that others can access, while also having a local copy on your machine for development. Local changes can then be uploaded (pushed) to the online canonical copy (like an update or bugfix). Alternatively, you don't have to put any repo online, GIT will still track the development of your project. To learn more about GIT, I highly recommend reading a few chapters from ["Getting started in the command line"](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line).

To access the git help documentation:
