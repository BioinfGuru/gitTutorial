Github is the most popular host for remote GIT repos so you'll want to learn how to connect GitHub from your machine.
Once you create a GitHub account, GitHub supports connection by HTTPS or SSH.
HTTPS will require you to provide your username and password each time you connect.
With SSH, you set up a trusted connection between your machine and GitHub so you provide your username and password on setup only.
