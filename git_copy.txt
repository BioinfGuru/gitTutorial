# Resolving conflicts #
#######################

You can't switch branches if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch youâ€™re trying to switch to
See: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
Consider GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/merge-conflict-tool

git status 									# view conflicts
with mergetool:
	git mergetool 							# resolve conflicts 1 by 1 (creates .orig file)
	git status								# check conflicts are resolved
	git add . 								# add all files including '.orig'
	git commit 								# to finish the merge --> now delete '.orig' files --> add --> amend commit
without mergetool:
	git checkout --theirs <file> 			# --theirs keeps remote version, --ours keeps local version --> add + commit
