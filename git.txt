# install
sudo apt-get install git-all

# set + check identity
git config --global user.name 'your full name'
git config --global user.email 'your email address'
git config --list

# help
git help clone 		# long version
git clone -h 		# abbreviate

# Easiest way to set up a repo with remote tracking:
cd into parent folder --> git clone <ssh>

# create repo
cd path/to/workingdirectory
git init

# updating a repo (after you make changes to the files)
git add .				# don't use '*' # also, if relocating a file, the output of git status should say 'R oldlocation/file -> newlocation/file'
git status -s 			# any red that you need green? run git add again
git diff --staged 		# see exactly what will change when you commit (verbose)
git commit -m 'meaningful message'
git rm --cached file1	# to remove a file from git tracking without deleting it
git rm file1			# to remove a file from git tracking + delete it
git mv oldname newname	# to rename files

# to veiw commit history
git log --oneline 		# lists commits made
git log -p 				# adds detailed description of changes
git log -p -2 			# shows only last 2 commits
git log --stat 			# adds graph showing amount of change in each file
git log -S 'string' 	# shows only commits that change 'string'

# redo the previous commit
git commit --amend -m 'meaningful message'

# unstage a file (undo "add")
git reset file

# return to previous commit
git reset --hard <hash> 	# careful, you will lose all changes not commited - 

# remotes
git remote -v						# to get the repository URLs of your remotes
git fetch -all						# updates info about tracked remotes (see link section 3.5)
git remote show <remote>			# display info about a remote
git remote rename <old> <new> 		# renames a repo (all branches) - easier on github
git remote remove <remote> 			# delete a remote (from local list of remotes)
git remote add <remote> <ssh>		# adds a remote (to local list of remotes)
git clone <ssh>						# pulls a repo + calls it 'origin/master'

# branching
Important: After making changes to a branch directory tree (e.g. relocating files, deleting adding folders etc), close all files before adding and commiting to remove the environment lock on the files otherwise when you switch branches, the directory tree wont change in the GUI
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all # shows all local branches + pointers, 'q' to quit
git branch -vv						# to see all branches + remotes they track [blue] + last commit
git branch <branch> 				# creates new branch (avoid naming folders and branches the same)
git checkout <branch> 				# switches to a branch
git merge <branch> 					# merges a branch with the current branch
git branch --no-merged 				# to view branches not merged with current branch
git branch --merged 				# to view branches merged with current branch
git branch -d <branch> 				# deletes a branch locally

# remotes + branching
git push <remote> <branch> 					# pushes checkedout branch to remote/branch (or creates remote/branch if it doesn't exist) 
git branch -u <remote>/<branch> 			# sets up checkedout branch to track remote/branch # switch -u for --unset-upstream to undo
git checkout --track <remote>/<branch> 		# creates local <branch> --> switches to local <branch> --> pulls and tracks <remote/branch>
git pull <remote> <branch>					# pulls + merges from remote
git push --delete <remote> <branch> 		# deletes a branch from the remote (recoverable for a short time)

# resolving conflicts (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
git status 							# view conflicts
with mergetool:
	git mergetool 						# resolve conflicts 1 by 1
	git add . 							# add all files including '.orig'
	git commit 							# to finish the merge --> now delete '.orig' files --> add --> amend commit
without mergetool:
	git checkout --theirs <file> 		# --theirs keeps remote version, --ours keeps local version --> add + commit

# add a repo
first create a new repo on your own comp
login to git hub and get an SSH key
click add new repository from drop down menu in upper right corner
follow instructions
click ssh
copy commands in 'push an existing repo'
git remote add origin git@github.com:roonysgalbi/tisSpec.git

# add a collaborator
repo --> settings --> collaborators --> add
this gives thow people commit access (they can write to your repo)
