During development there will be some files like that:
1) you won't want others to see
2) may make your repo look messy
3) are just part of your personal preferences setup
4) are just not part of the code of the project. 

For example: 	.log files
				.temp files

So before you go any further, lets set up a simple hidden file that tells GIT the files it should ignore.

cd projectname_repo
touch .gitignore
nano .gitignore
Paste the following into .gitignore, then save and exit

#######################
# My .gitignore file: #
#######################

# ignore all log files
*.log

# ignore all temp files
*.temp

# ignore all .orig files output from merge tools
*.orig
